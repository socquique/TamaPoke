Huge thanks to that whole community for an enormous amount of work.

> **Important if you reuse this repo:** the packaged sprite files
> (`tools/sdcard/mons/*.bin`) are derived from the sources above. Don't
> redistribute them commercially. If you publish the project, the clean approach
> is to distribute **only the code and scripts**, and have each user download and
> package the sprites from the original sources with `tools/pack_*.py` (or the web
> installer).
